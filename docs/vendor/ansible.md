# Ansible code

This contrib package provides METTA plugins for ansible interaction.

## Provisioner

The provisioner is the likely primary implementation for METTA.

The ansible provisioner is currently a stub.  It is completely non-blocking but
doesn't do anything yet.

This is looking for a contributor.
