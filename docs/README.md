# METTA

Welcome to the docs for the Universal Cluster Testing Toolbox

The testing toolbox is a python framework for managing temporary cluster
resources for the purpose of testing features of the cluster.

The toolbox should allow any code to create and access cluster resources directly.

Checkout our our `~./getting_started.md` introduction or move right into the
deeper documentation

Developers cant check out the `./developers` section and testers can look at
`./testers`.
