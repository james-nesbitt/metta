Welcome to the docs for the Mirantis Testing Toolbox

The mirantis testing toolbox is a python framework for managing temporary cluster
resources for the purpose of testing features of the cluster.

The toolbox should allow any code to create and access cluster resources directly.

Checkout our our `~./getting_started.md` introduction or move right into the
deeper documentation

Developers cant check out the `./developers` sectionm and testers can look at
`./testers`.
