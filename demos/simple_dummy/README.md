# Dymmy demo

This is a demo of running mtt with a dummy system.  It models the interface but
does not run any cluster management functionality.
The config object is fully active and tested.

PyTest fixtures are defined inline just to keep it simple

## Running this

You will need:

1. install pytest

now just run pytest

```
pytest -s
```
