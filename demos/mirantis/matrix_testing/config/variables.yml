# This config is used primarily for overrides in other config.
# It is handy because then we can focus on this file

# WHAT CAN I PUT HERE?
#
# If you are using the ltc variation, then look at mtt_mirantis/config/variations/ltc
# at the variables file there, and how variables:X are injected into the other config
# files there.
# Note also that values in mtt_mirantis may tell mtt to load more variables data from
# other folders in mtt_mirantis/config. You can still override those values here

# Used in terraform resource tagging (user:id gets set in conftest.py)
user: "{user:id?anon}"
#  arbitrary yet unique string which represents the deployment, eg, 'refactor', 'unicorn', 'stresstest'.

# One of the official cost-tracking project names. Without this, your cluster may get terminated without warning.

# A generic project/user id that we reuse across the configuration
id: "{user}-matrix"
# where the ltc variation should keep runtime paths like terraform state
files_path: "{paths:project}"
# Prefix all resource files we create with this, which allows multiples and id
files_prefix: "{id}"
# Prefix all created resources with this so that we can id them
# this is different than {id} to allow character limits to be avoided
