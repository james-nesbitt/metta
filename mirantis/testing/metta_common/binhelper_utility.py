METTA PLUGIN: bin download helper.

A helper plugin for downloading executables from the internet to help other
Plugins which might rely on external executables.

@NOTE remote urls may be tarballs/zips

@NOTE it goes without saying that downloading executables comes with an inherit
risk.  The request validates any certs, but it is up to you to make sure that
no config is in place which downloads dangerous bins.

The idea here is that you can tell your system to put bins from a list of
urls into a path, and have that path included in PATH in your python
environment. If you want, use a common system path like '/usr/local/bin' or
use a temporary or local path if you want to isolate versions for your test
suite.

There are two ways you can use this:

1. put a list of bins into the plugin config, and it will download when it is
constructed.  This de-couples acquiring bins from plugins that may use them, and
does all of the downloading up front before all fixtures are created.
If another fixture needs a bin in its own constructor, just make sure that this
fixture is created first.

2. any other code with access to the environment can access the binhelper
plugin and provide details to the `get_bin` method.  This couples the plugins,
and means that you will have to ensure that this plugin is available and handle
dependencies yourself.
