class KubernetesApiClientPlugin(ClientBase):
    """ metta Client plugin for Kubernetes

    Construction:
    -------------

    As an metta Plugin, the class constructor is used to initialize the instance
    as a plugin.  This means that we lose the constructor, but we gain access
    to an metta.config.Config object.

    We use .args() to configure the instance and create the client, as per the
    client plugin standard.

    To use:
    -------

    2. Ask metta.client.make_client for an instance of the plugin
        a. it is more expected that a provisioner will provide the client directly
        b. you can ask for the plugin directly from metta.plugin.get_plugin()
        c. you can use metta.new_clients_from_config() if you have some configuration
           with the needed args, and it will build clients for you
    3. Configure using .args() adding a kubeconfig file (with activated context)
       if that wasn't done for you when you received the client
    4. Ask the client for a kubernetes API version client
       (such as get_api('CoreV1Api') => CoreV1Api)
    5. Use the kubernetes API client as normal

    ```
    import mirantis.testing.metta as metta
    import mirantis.testing.metta.client as metta_client
    import mirantis.testing.metta_kubernetes as metta_kubernetes

    config = metta.new_config()
    client = metta_client.make_client(metta_kubernetes.METTA_PLUGIN_ID_KUBERNETES_CLIENT, config, 'my-k8-instance')

    client.args('path/to/k8file')

    coreV1 = client.get_api('CoreV1Api')
    ns = coreV1.read_namespace(name="kube-system")
    print("NS: {}".format(ns))
    ```

    Why use this:
    -------------

    It is cumbersome to use this if you already have access to the kubeconfig, but
    it fits into the plugin system, and therefore auto-loading and auto-configuring
    is possible with this implementation.
    Effectively, it is not easier to use this plu-gin over the native K8 client unless
    you consider that a provisioner can provide you this plugin already configured
    with its own information.

    This plugin is particularly usefull as it can be used for the helm and deployment
    workload plugins directly, which know how to use it to apply workloads to a
    kubernetes cluster.
