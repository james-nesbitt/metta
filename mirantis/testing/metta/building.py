    This class contains various functions that can be used to build Fixtures
    by interpreting either Configerus Config data or raw Python primitives.
    The class can be used as a Mixin to add the standardized building approach
    to any object that can provide Dict sources and a Fixture building
    callback.

    The callback is passed raw Fixture building arguments as
    interpreted. This allows avoiding being too strict about how Fixtures are
    finally built and we can stay out of some ugly circular imports.
