"""

An environment is meant to represent a testable cluster as a testing harness

In METTA an environment is a single configerus Config object and a set of
METTA plugins in a manageable set.

METTA uses the Fixtures object to manage a set of plugins, which allows us to
mix a bunch of plugin objects of different types together and manage them.

@NOTE states were just recently added and are currently inelegant and inefficient
  but should get a refactor soon.

        METTA bootstrapping is an attempt to allow an easy in to including contrib

        BootStrapping is a setuptools enabled process, where any python package can
        declare a bootstraper, and this function will run that bootstrapper on
        request.
        The BootStrap entry_points are expected to receive a config object on which
        they can operate to add any specific or global functionality.

        BootStraps are typically used for two behaviours:

        1. just import files which run configerus or metta decorators to register
            plugins
        2. add source/formatter/validator plugins to the passed config object.

        -----------

            ucct.bootstrap entry_points (part of setuptools.)
            Each value needs to refer to a valid entrypoint which will be executed
            with the config object as an argument.

        Raises:
