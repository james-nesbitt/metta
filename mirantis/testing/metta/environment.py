Environment definitions and functionality.

An environment in Metta is a container for the metta components. It is created
early and used to access all of the metta functionality.  For testing systems,
you can think of an environment as a collection of interconnected resources to
be managed together. If components need to be started or stopped together then
they are probably a part of the same environment.
When using Metta you can use more than one Environment object, but often you
don't need to.

The two primary components of an environment are:
1. A configerus config object to be shared by functionality that identifies as
  being in the environment.  This includes Metta components, but is intended to
  be used by external components as well.
2. A Fixtures set of Metta Fixture/Plugin components created in the environment.

In this file are defined two Environment plugins:

1. Default : a bare bones environment object, which you can use in any project
             to manually create fixtures/plugins and access them.
2. Builder : an environment with a number builder functions added to make it
             easier to create plugins en masse, using configerus config or from
             dicts of data.
             This environment also uses config for importing more python modules
             and for adding configerus config sources at runtime.

Almost all of the Mirantis test suites use the builder or a derivative, and the
default environment is there primarily as a stripped down simple version.
