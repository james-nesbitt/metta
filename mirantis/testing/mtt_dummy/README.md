# MTT Plugin : Dummy

A dummy plugin package, which offers dummy version of all of the plugins.

Dummy plugins should implement required behaviour (interfaces) but should not
be required to actually change any system state.
These dummy plugins are generated primarily to allow testing, but can be used
in production for cases where a plugin is expected but not functionality is
required.
