# This config is used primarily for overrides in other config.
# It is handy because then we can focus on this file

# WHAT CAN I PUT HERE?
#
# If you are using the tal variation, then look at metta/config/variations/tal
# at the variables file there, and how variables:X are injected into the other config
# files there.
# Note also that values in metta may tell metta to load more variables data from
# other folders in metta/config. You can still override those values here

# Used in terraform resource tagging (user:id gets set in conftest.py)
user: "{{user:id?anon}}"
#  arbitrary yet unique string which represents the deployment, eg, 'refactor', 'unicorn', 'stresstest'.
task: "npods"
# One of the official cost-tracking project names. Without this, your cluster may get terminated without warning.
