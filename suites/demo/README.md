# Demo test suites

These test suites show some ways of writing test suites for different purposes.

Some of the suites show test configuration options, some show how to interact
with fixtures that may be configured.  They don't all show the best way to
write a test, but they demonstrate functionality without complication.

Many of our PRODENG test suites were built using these demos but then taking
functionality out of the demo and into test abstratction.
