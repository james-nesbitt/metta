# In this file we define configuration used to create a Metta Environment.
#
# The environment object acts as a container for fixtures. The object itself
# will be created by the bootstrapper plugin which is defined in the root
# metta.yml file (it points here to define environments).
#
# Typically the bootstrapper creates this as a globally available fixture
# and the mirantis.testing.metta.get_environment() function can be used to
# retrieve it.
#
# The environment plugin we use is a BUILDER environment, which will use
# its own config to automatically build fixtures when it is created. The
# fixtures definition is below, but it typically redirects to a different
# fixtures.yml file.

# Create an environment called 'clients'
